# PoseEstimation-Framework
This Program tries to make multiple Pose-Estimation frameworks easily accessible over ros.
The first approaches to be integrated are [**`Cosypose`**](https://github.com/ylabbe/cosypose) and [**`PoseRBPF`**](https://github.com/NVlabs/PoseRBPF).

Before doing anything you have to set the `EST_HOME`-Variable as the main directory.
```bash
export EST_HOME=/path/to/root-dir/
```
Then set the `COSYPOSE-HOME` and the `PoseRBPF-HOME`
```bash
export COSYPOSE_HOME=/path/to/cosypose/
export POSERBPF_HOME=/path/to/poserbpf/
```
